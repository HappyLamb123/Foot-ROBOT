### File structure

This repository contains hundreds of simulation results for plate intruding and extracting in granular materials.
I divide those data into three parts:

1. **Extract**:

This part includes data when the plate extract from deeper area of the granular materials onto the shallow area.

2. **Intrude**

This part includes data when the plate intrude from the top of granular materials into the deeper area.

3. **Small angles**

This part includes data when the plaate intrude or extract with a small gamma angles (-18.36,18.36,-33.7,33.7). Since simulation with small gamma angles require wider x dimension, I put small angles cases out of the extract and the intrude.

### How to understand the output csv files

The output csv files have two types **output_plate_forces.csv** and **output_plate_positions.csv** which respectively write down the position and resistive forces information of the plate in simulations.
