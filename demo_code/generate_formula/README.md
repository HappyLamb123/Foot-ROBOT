# Demo code for foot intrude and extact

### 1. In both code, the foot (rigid plate) moves at constant speed with fixed body orientations.
### 2. To get the datasets for different intrusion and extract speed, you only need to change the  intrusion and extract velocities where I comment in those codes.
### 3. You should also choose the time_end carefully to make sure the plate is always move inside of the granular media. In addition, you can also change the initial positions of the plate to keep it inside the granular box
